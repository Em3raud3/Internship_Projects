# flask_web

This is my project I worked on at my Intership at datamachines.co over the 2021 summer

The objective of this project was to take the data that was of client's useage of our services and and visualize in a graph how often our products were used based on how many times users called the applicaiton.


In this project I accomplished the following

- Used python to read and write data into the an appropriate and useable format
- Used flask to create a small webapp that used D3 to visualize the data in the csv file that was generated in a stacking bar-graph.
- Dockerized the file
- Uploaded into GitLab and set up CI/CD
- Deployed it on VM's with Ansible
