# flask_web

This is my project I worked on at my Intership at datamachines.co over the 2021 summer

In this project I accomplished the following

- Used python to read and write data into the an appropriate and useable format
- Used flask to create a small webapp that used D3 to visualize the data in the csv file that was generated.
- Dockerized the file
- Uploaded into GitLab and set up CI/CD
